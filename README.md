# Quota Widget — releases

Download page for **Quota Widget**, a system-tray widget for Windows 11 and
Linux that watches your AI provider allowances in one place: Claude's rolling
5-hour window and weekly cap, Codex's weekly allowance, Hermes Portal credits,
OpenRouter, ElevenLabs, Firecrawl, DeepSeek and Moonshot balances, and
Fireworks, Anthropic and OpenAI organization spend.

This repository holds **published binaries only** — the source lives elsewhere
and is private. Nothing here is built from code you can read, so install it only
if you trust its author.

## Download

Grab the newest build from [**Releases**](../../releases/latest). Each release
carries:

| Asset | What it is |
|---|---|
| `QuotaWidget_<version>_x64-setup.exe` | NSIS installer — Start Menu entry and an uninstaller. Installs per-user, so no admin prompt. |
| `QuotaWidget_<version>_x64-portable.exe` | The single self-contained EXE. Put it anywhere and run it; nothing is installed. |
| `QuotaWidget_<version>_x64-setup.exe.sig` | Minisign signature over the installer, used to verify updates. |
| `latest.json` | Update manifest the app itself reads. Not something you download by hand. |

Windows 11 ships the WebView2 runtime the UI renders with, so there is no
separate runtime to install.

### Linux

**No Linux download is published here, and the app cannot update itself on
Linux.** The releases above are Windows-only.

This is not an oversight. A Linux build links GTK3 and WebKitGTK from the host
system rather than bundling them the way the Windows EXE bundles nothing at
all, so a single "portable" Linux binary would fail on any distribution whose
library versions differ from the one it was built on — which is most of them.
The supported Linux route is instead a Nix flake, which pins those libraries
exactly.

The flake lives in the source repository, which is private, so it is currently
available only to people who already have access to it. If you are reading this
and want to run it on Linux, open an issue — a public flake or an AppImage is
straightforward to add, it simply has not been needed yet.

The app's own update check is Windows-only for the same reason: on Nix, upgrade
with `nix profile upgrade`.

## First run

Right-click the tray icon → **Settings**, enable the providers you use, paste
any API keys, and set your thresholds. Optionally turn on **Start on login** — a
`HKCU` run entry on Windows, needing no admin rights.

Secrets (API keys, cookies, OAuth tokens) go into the **Windows Credential
Manager**, never to disk in plaintext. Configuration lives at
`%APPDATA%\quota-widget\config.json`.

## Updates

The app checks this repository's `latest.json` at startup and every six hours,
and shows an unobtrusive "Update available" line in Settings with a **Check
now** button. Uncheck **Check for updates** in Settings to turn the automatic
checks off; **Check now** keeps working either way.

On Windows an **Install update** button appears alongside it: the app downloads
the new installer, verifies its signature, and runs it. The app closes and
reopens partway through, which is expected. This works only if you installed via
the installer — a portable EXE cannot replace itself, so update it by
downloading the new one.

Where a release publishes nothing for your platform, the app still tells you a
newer version exists but offers no install button, since it has nothing it could
install. Upgrade however you installed it.

Builds made from a development branch carry a branch badge next to the version
and never check for updates at all, since they are usually ahead of the latest
release rather than behind it.

## Verifying a download

Releases are signed with minisign. To check an installer yourself, take the
`signature` value for your platform out of `latest.json` and verify it against
the public key baked into the app:

```
RWQHEg24HhWu6QFITG26y7995k+xW1CG3IHAplDddbIF1LahMc7G7fsz
```

The app verifies this signature itself before running a downloaded installer, so
checking by hand is only for the curious or the cautious.
